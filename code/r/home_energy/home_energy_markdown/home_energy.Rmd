## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#home energy statistics data merged with geo look up codes for local authority areas
home_energy <- read_csv(here("clean_data/home_energy.csv")) 

#current and potential
#Potential Emissions Overall Scotland
potential_home_energy <- home_energy %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_potential_emissions = round(exp(sum(log(potential_co2[potential_co2 > 0]), na.rm=TRUE) / length(potential_co2)), digits = 2)) 

#Current Emissions Overall Scotland
current_home_energy <- home_energy %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_current_emissions = round(mean(current_emissions_t_co2_yr), digits = 2)) 

current_potential = merge(current_home_energy, potential_home_energy, by="year")
head(current_potential)

current_potentialMelted <- reshape2::melt(current_potential, id.var='year')
head(current_potentialMelted)

cols <- c("#3c8dbc", "#5cbd9d")

#Map
#Reading in shapefile
la_map_scotland <- st_read(here("clean_data/scotland_map_files/scotland_council_areas_map.shp")) %>%  
  clean_names()

energy_means <- home_energy %>% 
  group_by(ca, ca_name, year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_co2_pfa = round(mean(co2_emissions_per_floor_area), digits = 2),
            mean_primary_energy = round(mean(primary_energy), digits = 2),
            mean_current_emissions = round(mean(current_emissions_t_co2_yr), digits = 2))
energy_means

#Energy means 2012 - 2020
energy_means_all <- energy_means %>% 
  group_by(ca, ca_name) %>% 
  summarise(mean_co2 = round(mean(mean_co2_pfa), digits = 2),
            mean_primary = round(mean(mean_primary_energy), digits = 2),
            mean_current_emissions_all = round(mean(mean_current_emissions), digits = 2))

#add labels for map
energy_means_all <- energy_means_all %>%
  mutate(
    leaflet_labels = paste(
      "<b>",
      ca_name,
      "</b>" ,
      br(),
      "Average Primary Energy: ",
      mean_primary,
      "kWh/m2/year",
      br(),
      "Average CO2 Emissions per CFA: ",
      mean_co2,
      "kg CO2e/m2/yr",
      br(),
      "Average Current Emissions: ",
      mean_current_emissions_all,
      "Tonnes per Year"
    )
  )


#joining home energy data with shapefile
la_scotland_home_energy <- la_map_scotland %>%
  left_join(energy_means_all, by = c("area_cod_1" = "ca"))

#Mean CO2 Emissions
# Set pallete for mean co2_emissions pfa across households in Scotland
pal_co2_emissions <- colorNumeric(palette = "YlGnBu",
                                  domain = la_scotland_home_energy$mean_co2)

#Mean Primary Energy
# Set pallete for mean primary energy across households in Scotland
pal_primary_energy <- colorNumeric(palette = "RdPu",
                                   domain = la_scotland_home_energy$mean_primary)

#Mean Current Emissions
# Set pallete for mean current emissions across households in Scotland
pal_current_emissions <- colorNumeric(palette = "OrRd",
                                      domain = la_scotland_home_energy$mean_current_emissions_all)


#Set boundaries of Scotland
bbox <- st_bbox(la_scotland_home_energy) %>%
  as.vector()

css = HTML("
  .leaflet-top, .leaflet-bottom {
    z-index: unset !important;
  }
  .leaflet-touch .leaflet-control-layers, .leaflet-touch .leaflet-bar {
    z-index: 10000000000 !important;
  }
")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
